## üìä Application Flow

1. **Document Upload**:
   - User uploads a document image via the upload form
   - Frontend sends the image to the backend API
   - Backend processes the image and returns extracted information
   - Frontend displays the document with extracted fields

2. **Document Viewing**:
   - User can view the original document image
   - Extracted fields are displayed alongside the image
   - Fields are highlighted based on confidence level

3. **Field Editing**:
   - User can edit any extracted field
   - Changes are validated in real-time
   - Updated fields are saved to the backend

4. **Document History**:
   - User can browse previously processed documents
   - Click on a document to view its details and make changes

## üß© Key Components

### UploadForm
Handles document upload and initial processing. Uses React Dropzone for drag-and-drop functionality.

### DocumentView
Displays the document image alongside extracted information. Includes zoom and pan functionality.

### FieldEditor
Provides interface for editing extracted fields with validation.

### DocumentList
Displays a history of processed documents with search and filter capabilities.

## üîå API Integration

- `POST /api/documents` - Upload and process documents
- `GET /api/documents` - Fetch document history
- `PATCH /api/documents/{id}` - Update extracted fields
